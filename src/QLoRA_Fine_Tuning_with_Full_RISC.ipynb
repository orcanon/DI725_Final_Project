    "# Fine Tune PaliGemma with QLoRA for Visual Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn about PaliGemma briefly and demonstrate how to fine-tune it using the QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) technique to achieve improved inference results, helping us create a custom vision-language model tailored to our specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "PaliGemma is an open Vision-Language Model (VLM) released by Google. It builds on the PaLI (Pathways Language and Image) series and the Gemma family of language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "While many VLMs are getting larger to handle more tasks, PaliGemma focuses on being smaller and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compact Size: Only about 3B parameters, significantly smaller than many VLMs.\n",
    "* Competitive Performance: Can be fine-tuned to match the capabilities of larger models.\n",
    "* Adaptability: Efficient and easy to customize for various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is a Vision-Language Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Vision-Language Model (VLM) combines visual and textual understanding, processing images and text simultaneously to grasp their relationship. This enables VLMs to handle tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "How VLMs Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Image Processing: A component specifically trained to interpret visual data.\n",
    "Language Processing: Another component designed to handle textual information.\n",
    "Joint Understanding: The model learns how visuals and language relate, enabling it to describe images or answer questions about them.\n",
    "For example, a VLM can look at a picture of a dog and generate a descriptive sentence about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As VLMs have evolved, they have become more powerful, with larger models able to handle more complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, recent efforts also focus on creating smaller, more efficient VLMs (e.g., PaliGemma) that can perform just as well without massive computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture of PaliGemma\n",
    "PaliGemma is a simple input+text-in, text-out model that takes an image and text as input and generates text as output. PaliGemma’s architecture is built on three key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "PaliGemma uses the SigLIP (Sigmoid loss for Language-Image Pre-training) checkpoint, a publicly available image encoder.\n",
    "Specifically, it leverages the “shape optimized” Vision Transformer (ViT So400m).\n",
    "This model is pre-trained on a large scale using contrastive learning with a sigmoid loss, enabling it to process and understand images effectively.\n",
    "### Decoder-Only Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "PaliGemma integrates the Gemma-2B model, a publicly available pre-trained language model for the language component.\n",
    "As a decoder-only model, it is designed to generate text based on both image and language inputs, allowing for tasks like image captioning or answering questions about an image.\n",
    "### Linear Layer Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "The output tokens from the SigLIP encoder are linearly projected into the same dimension as the Gemma-2B model’s vocabulary tokens.\n",
    "This linear projection ensures that the image and language features can be seamlessly combined and used for downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Is PaliGemma Trained?\n",
    "Inspired by the Pathways Language and Image (PaLI-3) models, PaliGemma follows the same training stages. The training stages are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 0: Unimodal Pretraining\n",
    "\n",
    "* The unimodal components of PaliGemma are pre-trained individually to leverage established training methods.\n",
    "* No custom unimodal pre-training is performed; publicly available checkpoints are utilized.\n",
    "* A SigLIP image encoder, specifically the “shape optimized” ViT-So400m model, is smaller yet effective compared to larger models like ViT-G.\n",
    "* The model adopts the Gemma-2B decoder-only language model, balancing size and performance.\n",
    "### Stage 1: Multimodal Pretraining\n",
    "\n",
    "* This stage combines unimodal models and trains them on various vision-language tasks.\n",
    "* The focus is on creating a base model that can be fine-tuned well for diverse tasks rather than just aligning modalities.\n",
    "* The image encoder remains frozen initially to maintain representation quality, although it later learns from tasks that provide valuable signals.\n",
    "* Training occurs at 224px resolution with 1 billion examples, aiming to cover a wide array of concepts and languages.\n",
    "### Stage 2: Resolution Increase\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model from Stage 1 is valuable but limited to 224×224 pixel resolution, which is insufficient for tasks requiring higher detail.\n",
    "* Two additional checkpoints are trained at resolutions of 448×448 and 896×896 pixels.\n",
    "* Stage 2 emphasizes increasing resolution while retaining the task diversity from Stage 1, with fewer examples but higher information density.\n",
    "* The text sequence length is increased to 512 tokens for tasks that demand detailed input.\n",
    "### Stage 3: Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stages 1 and 2 produce checkpoints at different resolutions rich in visual knowledge.\n",
    "* These models need to be fine-tuned for specific tasks to be user-friendly.\n",
    "* The model can be adapted for various inputs, including multiple images and bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Available Model Checkpoints\n",
    "Google has released three types of PaliGemma models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pretrained Checkpoints**: These are base models trained on large datasets that can be further fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks.\n",
    "1. **Mix Checkpoints**: These base models have been fine-tuned on various tasks, making them easy to use with general-purpose free-text prompts.\n",
    "1. **Fine-Tuned Checkpoints**: These base models have been fine-tuned for specific tasks, providing targeted performance for particular applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases of PaliGemma\n",
    "Keeping vision applications in mind, here are some tasks PaliGemma can be used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Image and Short Video Captioning: Asking the model to generate descriptive captions for pictures or short videos.\n",
    "* Visual Question Answering: Asking the model to generate relevant answers to specific questions about an image.\n",
    "* Document Understanding: Asking the model to generate answers to specific questions about the text shown in the image.\n",
    "* Diagram Understanding: Asking the model to generate answers to specific questions about diagrams shown in the image.\n",
    "* Object Detection: Asking the model to identify (output bounding box coordinates) and label objects within an image.\n",
    "* Object Segmentation: Asking the model to segment (output polygon coordinates) that bound the detected objects in an image (shown in Figure 2).\n",
    "* Science Question Answering: Asking the model to provide specific answers to questions related to scientific content, using visual inputs like graphs or diagrams in addition to text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why PaliGemma?\n",
    "PaliGemma’s compact architecture makes it highly effective across multiple tasks while keeping the model size manageable.\\\n",
    "Its key components (e.g., an image encoder, a language decoder, and a projection layer) allow it to handle complex tasks without requiring the massive computational power that larger models might need.\\\n",
    "Overall, PaliGemma’s flexibility makes it a powerful tool for any task requiring a deep understanding of images and text."
